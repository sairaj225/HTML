       <p><b>Master of Computer Applications </b>(MCA) is a professional post-graduate programme for 
        individuals aiming to delve deeper into the world of application development through the way
         of learning modern programming language.  
        A blend of both - theoretical and practical knowledge, 
        an MCA degree offers students a chance to work with tools 
        meant to develop better and faster applications.

        <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
            JNTU College of Engineering, Kakinada was established 
            in the year 1990. The PGDCA Program was initiated in 
            the year 1987 - 1988 and was the first Computer 
            Oriented course to be offered. This course was initially started 
            in the ECE Department. In the year 1989 - 1990, B.Tech. Program in 
            Computer Science and Engineering was started and was the second 
            computer-related program, which was also offered from the ECE Department 
            for that year only. Later, after the establishment of CSE Department separately 
            in 1990, it continued to offer the above-mentioned two courses. From 1996, M.C.A. 
            program was started, from 2000-2001 M.Tech. (Full time) and from 2001-2002.</p>
